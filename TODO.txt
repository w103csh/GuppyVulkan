 - Investigate the issue you saw in release mode where models loaded
    asynchronously had the wrong textures!!!!

 - Make buffer manager data an array instead of a void pointer with the alignment
    padding added (The host memory only needs the alignment padding).

 - Make texture params dynamic. All of the vulkan options are inaccessible.

 - Add visual helpers back (Didn't add it back after instancing).

 - Instance base class should probably inherit Object3d so common model space
    operations are available (Would it be super slow????). This would make
    things like selection on instances possible.

 - Add a .ini file that can store some state (like camera position) that can be
    loaded on start, so that things are easier to debug.

 - Figure out the issue with alpha blending for transparent fragments. There is
    a comment about this in link.texture.frag, and in the default render pass
    intializer list.

 - Countless more...
