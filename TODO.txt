 - In "glaring exampler of problem with smoothing.png" I used the fragNormal variable
    as Kd.

 - Make material creation public similar to instance data creation, because
    it is shared data/pointer.

 - Make all the const variables in Constant.h/elsewhere extern, so that
    you can change the values without having to recompile everything.

 - Add a .ini file that can store some state (like camera position) that can be
    loaded on start, so that things are easier to debug.

 - Split the sampler creation info and validation into image|view data (i.e.
    arrayLayers v. layerCount). You can see this very clearly in the table here:
    https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkImageViewCreateInfo.html

 - Investigate the issue you saw in release mode where models loaded
    asynchronously had the wrong textures!!!! When you investigate this
	also make it possible to load instance data asynchronously in a callback
	so that creating a bunch of instances isn't so slow.

 - Make buffer manager data an array instead of a void pointer with the alignment
    padding added (The host memory only needs the alignment padding).

 - Figure out the issue with alpha blending for transparent fragments. There is
    a comment about this in link.texture.frag, and in the default render pass
    intializer list.

 - Add a normal matrix.

 - Use immutable samplers.

 - Parallax mapping never worked right. To me, it looked like it could have been
    because of a couple things:
        -! Multisampling was distorting the tex coord offsetting.
        - Should "v" be negated? Is the step moving in the right direction?
        - ...

 - In "glaring exampler of problem with smoothing.png" I used the fragNormal variable
    as Kd.

 - Fix what seems like a memory barrier problem with mipmap generation. The symptoms
    for this problem are all the errors/warnings in RenderDOC when you load just load
    the "Orange" model.

 - The depth buffer doesn't work without a ground plane!!! WTF

 - Countless more...
