 - Investigate the issue you saw in release mode where models loaded
    asynchronously had the wrong textures!!!! When you investigate this
	also make it possible to load instance data asynchronously in a callback
	so that creating a bunch of instances isn't so slow.

 - Make buffer manager data an array instead of a void pointer with the alignment
    padding added (The host memory only needs the alignment padding).

 - Make texture params dynamic. All of the vulkan options are inaccessible.

 - Instance base class should probably inherit Object3d so common model space
    operations are available (Would it be super slow????). This would make
    things like selection on instances possible.

 - Add a .ini file that can store some state (like camera position) that can be
    loaded on start, so that things are easier to debug.

 - Figure out the issue with alpha blending for transparent fragments. There is
    a comment about this in link.texture.frag, and in the default render pass
    intializer list.

 - Add a normal matrix.

 - Use immutable samplers.

 - Parallax mapping never worked right. To me, it looked like it could have been
    because of a couple things:
        - The delta varialble in the fragment shaders where offsetting the tex
            coord in the same direction regardless of view direction.
        -! Multisampling was distorting the tex coord offsetting.
        - ...

 - Countless more...
