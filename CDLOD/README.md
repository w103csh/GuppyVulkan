# CDLOD
This code comes from here [CDLOD (2010)](http://github.com/fstrugar/CDLOD). I grabbed a few of the files, brought them into the repo here, and altered them slightly so that they could build and be used with [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.4/api/index.html). I did this so that I could see how the **quad tree** code worked because the [paper](https://github.com/fstrugar/CDLOD/blob/master/cdlod_paper_latest.pdf) was fairly vague about the mathematical implementation.

> The plan is to use a tessellated **quad tree** for terrain generation. This has not yet been implemented though. I also plan to alter the files for my specific needs, so if you want to see the original code you should go the repository linked above.
