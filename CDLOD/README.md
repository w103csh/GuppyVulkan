# CDLOD
This code originates from the repo [CDLOD (2010)](http://github.com/fstrugar/CDLOD). I grabbed a few of the files, brought them into the repo here, and altered them as little as possible so that they could build and be used with [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.4/api/index.html), [Vulkan](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/home/welcome), and anything else I am forgetting. I did this so that I could see how the **quad tree** code worked because the [paper](https://github.com/fstrugar/CDLOD/blob/master/cdlod_paper_latest.pdf) was fairly vague about the implementation.

> The plan is to use a **quad tree** for adaptive terrain tessellation. I recently got a basic debug version of the code working in here in Guppy. Hopefully an ocean surface demo is forthcoming. Any demo of this functionality will be somewhere in the main [demo section](https://github.com/w103csh/GuppyVulkan#rendering). I also plan to alter the files for my specific needs, so if you want to see the original code you should go the repository linked above. I also forked the original repo and made modifications so that it can work with VS 2019 which is [here](https://github.com/w103csh/CDLOD). You still need to download and install [D3DX9](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) in order for it to work though.
