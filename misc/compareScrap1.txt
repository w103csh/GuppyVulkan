Write update to VkDescriptorSet 0xa2allocated with VkDescriptorSetLayout 0x2a binding #0 failed with error message:

Attempted write update to combined image sampler descriptor failed due to:

Descriptor update with descriptorType VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER is being updated with
invalid imageLayout VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL. Allowed layouts are: VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL,
VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_READ_ONLY_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL,
VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL. The Vulkan spec states: If descriptorType is VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLED_IMAGE
or VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER, the imageLayout member of each element of pImageInfo must be a member of the list given
in Sampled Image or Combined Image Sampler, corresponding to its type (https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VUID-VkWriteDescriptorSet-descriptorType-01403)
