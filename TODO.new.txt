  o Hook up CDLOD to the ocean surface heightmap.
  o Fix smoothing issues with the surface.
    o I currently think that the chopiness factor (lamda) is causing this problem. The calculation
      that determines the height also displaces the position laterally, which is not accounted for
      in the normal.
        o Re-read the paper and see if there is something in there about this.
        o Try a smoothing compute convolution pass?
  o Fix subpass dependencies. I think this is also covered by best practices.
  o Turn on validation layers (best practices, etc.)
  o Move static CreatInfo out of struct and just set in constructors of handlee's (NAME, TYPE, etc.)
    and have all handlee's take the CreateInfo in an Init function. This way the reset/init pattern
    can be used to create dynamic pipelines and things easier. At this point I should probably move
    closer to the OnInit/init, OnReset/reset, etc. pattern.
  o If sky box is going to be a cubemap I render to then render the cubemap one frame and sample the
    the cubemap the next frame, so I can remove all dependencies from the cubemap rendering.
  o Add screen space volumetric lighting.
  o Add cloud generation.
  o Add boat.
  o Add PhysX around time of boat.
  o Fix command buffers re-recording when they don't need to.
